** This plugin is now included in the base repository https://github.com/axtimwalde/mpicbg **

This repository extends the Fiji SIFT Align plugin (https://imagej.net/Linear_Stack_Alignment_with_SIFT) in order to process 5D stacks.

The registration is done on a channel of interest, the transformation is applied to all the other channels.

Original SIFT_Align plugin code: https://github.com/axtimwalde/mpicbg/blob/master/mpicbg_/src/main/java/SIFT_Align.java

This plugin is available via the PTBIOP update site (Linear_Stack_Alignment_with_SIFT_MultiChannel).
